  full: >-
    This report shows that compensation plans have not met the needs of victims of nuclear disasters for three primary reasons: compensation plans have been devised by unelected officials and without full public knowledge or participation, governments have often capped the liability of the owners of nuclear facilities, which distorts cost-benefit analysis and creates a moral hazard,international conventions limit compensation and responsibility for nuclear disasters. Both Chernobyl and Fukushima demonstrate that these limits may be too low. In this report we call for the creation of a forum that enables laypersons and experts to engage in an ongoing conversation about nuclear disaster compensation issues before the next disaster occurs.
