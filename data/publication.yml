description:
  one_line: In this report we call for the creation of a forum that enables laypersons and experts to engage in an ongoing conversation about nuclear disaster compensation issues before the next disaster occurs.
  full: >-
    This report shows that compensation plans have not met the needs of victims of nuclear disasters for three primary reasons: compensation plans have been devised by unelected officials and without full public knowledge or participation, governments have often capped the liability of the owners of nuclear facilities, which distorts cost-benefit analysis and creates a moral hazard,international conventions limit compensation and responsibility for nuclear disasters. Both Chernobyl and Fukushima demonstrate that these limits may be too low. In this report we call for the creation of a forum that enables laypersons and experts to engage in an ongoing conversation about nuclear disaster compensation issues before the next disaster occurs.

      Hirokazu Miyazaki was born in Tokyo and was originally trained in anthropology in Japan and at the Australian National University, where he earned a Ph.D. as a specialist of Fiji and the Pacific Islands. Miyazaki subsequently contributed to the formation of the interdisciplinary field of the social studies of finance. His current research focuses on the history of citizen diplomacy for peace and the world without nuclear weapons. In February 2018, Miyazaki was appointed by the Mayor of Nagasaki as a Peace Correspondent for Nagasaki. Before joining the NU Department of Anthropology as the Kay Davis Professor, Miyazaki taught anthropology at Cornell University for sixteen years. From July 2015-June 2018, Miyazaki served as the Director of the Mario Einaudi Center for International Studies and the John S. Knight Professor of International Studies at Cornell. Miyazaki’s research has long been driven by a very simple question: how do we keep hope alive? Miyazaki has investigated the question ethnographically in several different field sites: Suva, Fiji, Tokyo, Nagasaki and Rochester, N.Y.
