This report shows that compensation plans have not met the needs of victims of nuclear disasters for three primary reasons:

1.  Compensation plans have been devised by unelected officials and without full public knowledge or participation.

2.  Governments have often capped the liability of the owners of nuclear facilities, which distorts cost-benefit analysis and creates a moral hazard.

3.  International conventions limit compensation and responsibility for nuclear disasters. Both Chernobyl and Fukushima demonstrate that these limits may be too low.

In this report we call for the creation of a forum that enables laypersons and experts to engage in an ongoing conversation about nuclear disaster compensation issues before the next disaster occurs. The forum should include the many groups that are affected by nuclear power and disasters, including nuclear industry representatives, government officials, project finance specialists, political leaders, victims of past disasters, potential victims, taxpayers, and ratepayers. Many methods for enabling conversation between experts and their publics have been developed and so this forum may take a variety of forms, including as a consensus conference. It could take place online and/or include online components. With this report we invite your suggestions for methods of achieving this conversation, as well as your participation in this dialogue.

The final form of the forum must enable three goals. First, a deliberative conversation about nuclear disaster compensation must be **anticipatory**—that is, it must take place prior to the disaster occurring. Many dedicated professionals are working to prevent future disasters but the case studies presented later in this report show that governments have not fully planned for nuclear disasters before the disasters have occurred. In short:

-   Plans have failed to anticipate the magnitude and types of harms that people experience after disasters, or precisely how people will be compensated.

-   Some plans have created loopholes for “natural” disasters, which may not ensure that owners of nuclear facilities adequately prepare for environmental hazards.

-   Organizational sociologists have shown that interactive complexity and tight coupling makes nuclear disasters “normal,” even with the best possible management and governance structures in place—and the real world is far from the best possible world.

-   The problem of nuclear disaster compensation has often been marginalized by assurances that the probability of a disaster is very low. As a result, citizens have too often accepted plans for nuclear power because they are assured that a disaster is extremely unlikely, and citizens have not understood the possible effects of a disaster. However, history shows that this assumption is flawed. Nuclear disasters have repeatedly occurred and they will almost certainly continue to occur.

The tendency to explain each nuclear disaster as an anomaly—an *unusual* case of operator error, irresponsible governance, poor engineering, or all of the above—only serves to reinforce the misguided faith that nuclear disasters can be entirely prevented.

This leads to the second goal of a forum on nuclear disaster compensation issues: deliberations must be **participatory**—that is, they must include the ordinary citizens who have been impacted or are likely to be impacted by a nuclear disaster, as well as nuclear engineers, doctors, environmental scientists, and other experts who have specialized knowledge relevant to disasters. We recognize, though, that participatory governance of science and technology faces challenges, especially as experience with participatory governance shows that not all groups are able to contribute equally. Citizens who participate in decision-making about nuclear power are often economically disadvantaged. They do not “choose” to accept the risks of living and working in proximity to nuclear power and nuclear waste disposal but do so because they are typically desperate for the jobs and economic opportunities that nuclear power and waste disposal are seen to offer. While these citizens often “participate” in nuclear decision-making, they are rarely on equal footing with governments and corporations. The experts who play an outsized role in framing problems and solutions instead give citizens simple yes-or-no votes in otherwise complicated processes.

A truly participatory forum would recognize the extremely broad group of people who are affected by nuclear disasters and enable them to help frame problems and solutions. Nuclear disasters affect not only the people living close to nuclear facilities, but also everyone in the path of fallout, which can spread around the entire globe. It affects the costs and reliability of electricity for all persons on the electrical power grid. And it affects the livelihood of agricultural workers and the supply of food that they provide.A participatory forum would also ensure that all of hese citizens understand what they might lose in a nuclear disaster. The impacts of previous disasters must be fully visible to those considering accepting such risks. We can begin to create a more participatory forum by broadening conceptions of expertise to include forms of knowledge that have traditionally been marginalized in decision-making about nuclear power. This includes local knowledge about the cultural significance and practices of regions that could be destroyed or contaminated by a nuclear disaster and interdisciplinary knowledge about disaster response and recovery.

This leads to the third goal of a conversation about nuclear disaster compensation: it must be **transnational** because nuclear disasters do not respect national borders. Although methods for participatory governance have proliferated in recent years, most of these experiences have been confined to single nations or localities. Nonetheless, there are models for a transnational forum. For example, Meridian 180 Forums bring together diverse experts and publics from around the world. Nongovernmental organizations often gather alongside intergovernmental meetings on climate change. A transnational conversation should include decision-makers and citizens from nations that are considering investing in nuclear power. Such nations should explicitly consider the risks of nuclear disasters in their costs-benefits analysis. The costs of disaster compensation may go beyond compensating their citizens and impact their neighbors and others in the international community. Again, current international agreements strongly limit compensation and responsibility for disasters.

In sum, we are calling for a dialogue that is **anticipatory**, **participatory**, and **transnational** to best enable wiser decisions about nuclear power and its many consequences. We invite your ideas about possible forums that can move the conversation forward.
